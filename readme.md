# Automated BCDC Testing

A work in progress at the moment.  At some point we may integrate this repo with 
the BCDC repository but for now for simplicities sake its separate.

Testing in this repository for the near future will be focused on the backend 
bcdc rest api.  Currently working on developing a list of test cases that need 
to be developed.  Once complete will include link to those.
