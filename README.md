# Automated BCDC API Testing 

Intention is to test the CKAN API after deployment.

Current tests include:
 - verification of preconfigured orgs required for testing
 - CRUD tests for packages.
 
# OC Build

how to create new build without starting
  
```
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/bcdc-test/dev/k8s/bcdc-test-buildconfig.yaml
```

start build after created or start future incremental builds.

```
oc start-build bcdc-test
```

# OC Job 

each environment will have its own defined .yaml file within the k8s dir. 

* test-dwelf-job-template.yaml
* test-toyger-job-template.yaml
* test-puma-job-template.yaml

how to run job from yaml as template, so we can change the name using a generated value appended to name
